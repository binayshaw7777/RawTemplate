## Why we developed this project?
- Situation
  - Development process consists of many phases like Ideation, Analysis, Prototype, Designing, Implementation/Development, testing and repeat.
  - Everytime you have an idea, at some point of time you might have thought or waste your time looking for the resources like Splashscreen, Onboarding Screen, SignUp elements and other components.

- Task
  - We thought to make a template project that at least covers the important and most widely used components
  - As majority of the Android developers use Kotlin, so this is why we chose Kotlin to meet the requirements
  
- Action
  - We started ideation and prototpying a month ago and slowly and gradually decided what to add in the project
  - The app is complete as a template, to make sure that we analyzed many real life projects that has the same components.
  - It took us some time but it's benefit to us also at the end of the day.

- Result
  - The app is complete and ready to be used in your projects and save a lot of time of development. 
  - You just focus on the logic and your app, the rest of the work if already done :)
  - The app is not perfect, to make that we made it Open Source.
  - Any improvements or changes are always welcome :D
